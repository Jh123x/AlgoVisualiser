# Algo Visualiser

## What does this do?
- Visualise your algorithms based on what you code


## Quick Start
1. Go to `__main__.py` file
2. Create a new function
3. Pass the function into the `game = Animate(Your Function, (source, target), dim = number of squares, resolution= resolution)`


## Instructions when using
1. `Space bar` to start the simulation
1. `left click` to set which squares are blocked (Click same squares again to unblock)
1. `r` to reset the simulation
1. `e` to reset the blocking


## Tech Stack
1. [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)


## Know Bugs
1. Unable to work with recursive functions
